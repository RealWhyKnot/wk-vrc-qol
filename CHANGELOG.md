## Unreleased

### Fixed
- `PhysBoneReinitHook.cs` no longer passes a Unity `Component` as the second argument to `AvatarQolLogger.Instance.Warning(...)`. Side effect of the 1.1.0-beta.3 mass migration from `Debug.LogWarning(msg, contextObject)` -- the regex stripped the `Debug.LogWarning(` prefix but left the trailing context argument behind, which clashed with `WkLogger.Warning`'s `[CallerMemberName] string member = ""` parameter and failed CS1503. The context object reference is dropped; the offending component's `name` is already interpolated into the message.

### Added
- **logging:** Every diagnostic line in this package now routes through `AvatarQolLogger.Instance` (the package's registered `WkLogger`). Sessions are written to `%LocalAppData%/WhyKnot/Logs/dev.whyknot.avatar-qol/session-<timestamp>.log`, capped at 3 retained sessions per package. Each line carries a level tag, source file:line, calling method, and message. Info, Warning, and Error mirror to the Unity Console as before; Debug stays file-only. The session file is project-independent so a bug report can point at the same path regardless of which Unity project surfaced it. Multi-line StringBuilder dumps from `WeightSanityCheckWindow` (Inspect Vertex, Weight Dump, verbose scan log) and `PhysBoneClippingRiskWindow` (verbose scan log) now go through the logger too.
- **theming:** Tool window OnGUI / OnInspectorGUI bodies open `using (WkStyles.Scope(WkTheme.WhyKnot))` so the IMGUI palette emits the WhyKnot brand colors (black / gray / light blue). Covers Weight Sanity Check, PhysBone Preset, PhysBone Clipping Risks, Bone Merger, Mesh Fix window, and the AutoTightenToBody / MeshFixController inspector editors.

### Changed
- **deps:** Bumped `dev.whyknot.core` dependency to `>=1.1.0` so the new theming system and `WkLogger` are guaranteed available.
- **deps:** Add `dev.whyknot.core` (>=1.0.0) as a hard `vpmDependency`. VCC auto-installs the shared utility package alongside vrc-avatar-qol. Internal-only refactor that moves `AvatarQolStyles` (palette + lazy GUIStyles + IMGUI primitives) -> `WkStyles`, `HumanoidSideMap` + `BoneSide` -> `WhyKnot.Core.Utilities`, `GetGameObjectPath` -> `WhyKnot.Core.Utilities.PathUtility`, and the FBX-clone helper that `WeightFixer` and `BoneMergerWindow` duplicated -> `WhyKnot.Core.Utilities.FbxMeshUtility`. The three domain-specific issue-category colors (humanoid / spatial / center) stay in this package as `AvatarQolCategoryColors`. No user-visible behaviour change beyond Ctrl+Z on `WeightFixer` now also removing the cloned `.mesh` asset from disk (parity with Bone Merger's existing behaviour).
- **deps:** Bump actions/checkout from 4 to 6 (#1) (0d8ab2b)
- Mesh Fix pipeline: fix native-array leak, missing using, idempotent delayCall, preview leak; only clone write-target meshes (31d1746)
- Editor asmdef: gate WHYKNOT_NDMF on nadena.dev.ndmf >=1.0.0; qualify Object disambiguation (5785f9d)
- Surrounding tools: WeightFixer handshake; Clipping Keep/Merge/Overwrite (3221b6d)
- Mesh Fix pipeline: redesign Auto Mesh Fixes around plan/apply with shape registry (e3b5885)
- Add Auto Mesh Fixes, PhysBone Clipping Risks, Bone Merger; namespace tools under WhyKnot/vrc-avatar-qol (1471d75)
- Editor asmdef: drop the speculative WHYKNOT_NDMF versionDefine (5a7f5e1)

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/RealWhyKnot/vrc-avatar-qol/releases/tag/v1.0.1) -- 2026-05-07

### Changed
- License: switched from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later. Same set of users can use, modify, and redistribute; downstream forks now propagate the GPL terms instead of MIT's permissive ones.
- Repo infra: auto-maintained `CHANGELOG.md` via verified bot commits on every push to `main` (conventional-commit subjects bucket into Added/Changed/Fixed). Branch protection ruleset on `main` now requires signed commits.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/RealWhyKnot/vrc-avatar-qol/releases/tag/v1.0.0) -- 2026-05-03

First release as a VRChat Package Manager (VPM) package, installable via the Creator Companion at `https://vpm.whyknot.dev/index.json`.

### Added
- VPM package metadata (`package.json`) declaring `dev.whyknot.avatar-qol` with a hard `vpmDependencies` on `com.vrchat.avatars` (>= 3.5.0).
- Editor assembly definition (`Editor/dev.whyknot.avatar-qol.Editor.asmdef`) scoping the tools to the Editor platform and gating the SDK-conditional code via `versionDefines` for `VRC_SDK_VRCSDK3`.

### Changed
- **Breaking for loose-script users.** Prior to 1.0.0 the recommended install was to drop the `Editor/` folder anywhere under your `Assets/` tree; Unity compiled the scripts into the project's default editor assembly. With the new asmdef, code now compiles into a dedicated `dev.whyknot.avatar-qol.Editor` assembly. If you were previously importing as loose scripts and you upgrade by adding the asmdef in place, *internal* type references inside this package keep working, but any **external** code in your project that referenced these tools' types (e.g. `WhyKnot.AvatarQol.AvatarQol` from your own scripts) will need its asmdef to add `dev.whyknot.avatar-qol.Editor` to its `references`.
- Recommended migration: remove the old loose-script copy from `Assets/` and reinstall via VCC. Unity asset GUIDs are regenerated on import; nothing inside this package references its own files by GUID, so no project-side cleanup is required beyond removing the duplicate.

### Notes
- The `#if VRC_SDK_VRCSDK3` blocks in `PhysBonePlanApplier` and `PhysBonePresetWindow` are preserved verbatim. They are now effectively always-on (the package hard-depends on `com.vrchat.avatars`, which sets the define via `versionDefines`), but kept for future flexibility if the dependency is later relaxed.
